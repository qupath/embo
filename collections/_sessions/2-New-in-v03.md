## Overview

QuPath v0.3.0 isn't *quite* released yet, but the first (only?) Release Candidate has been made available for this workshop.

Here, I ask you to quickly recap what you've (hopefully) already done with QuPath, as a prelude to exploring something new.
</div>

You can [download QuPath v0.3.0-rc1 here](https://github.com/qupath/qupath/releases/tag/v0.3.0-rc1).

The main [QuPath ReadTheDocs](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/stable) is still for v0.2, but you can already get the docs for v0.3 at [https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

One of the biggest changes (since yesterday) is that there are now video tutorials.
Therefore if you had any trouble with the pre-workshop material, these could help:

* [Projects](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/projects.html)
* [Separating stains](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/separating_stains.html)
* [Detecting tissue](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/thresholding.html)
* [Measuring areas](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/measuring_areas.html)
* [Cell detection](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/cell_detection.html)
* [Cell classification](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/cell_classification.html)

But the **main** purpose of this part of the workshop is to explore an entirely new feature **Density maps**.

### Your challenge

* Create a new project and add the workshop images to it
* Open `OS-2.ndpi`
* Run *Positive cell detection* and train an object classifier to distinguish between tumor & non-tumor cells
  * To speed things up, you can focus on the middle part of the image and use a *Requested pixel size* of 1 Âµm
* **Find the circle with area 0.785 mm<sup>2</sup> that contains the highest number of positive tumour cells** 
* Create a screenshot displaying the circle, and count how many positive tumor cells it contains

To do this, you should **follow the tutorial at [https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/density_maps.html](https://qupath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/tutorials/density_maps.html)** and find the combination of parameters needed to get the answer.
